**User:** Using only Javascript and HTML, how can I produce an animation file that is produced from a sequence of HTML canvas elements and then is made downloadable via a data URL?

**Assistant:** You can create an animation from a sequence of HTML `<canvas>` frames using JavaScript by rendering the sequence to a video format (like WebM) or compiling it into a GIF, and then exporting it via a data URL.

Since GIF encoding is simpler and doesn't require Web APIs like `MediaRecorder`, we'll use that approach here using a JavaScript library like [gif.js](https://jnordberg.github.io/gif.js/), which runs entirely in the browser.

Would you like an example using `MediaRecorder` instead (for WebM video export)?

**User:** Yes, show me an example using MediaRecorder and using no external resources.

**Assistant:** Sure! Here's a **complete, self-contained example** of generating an animation using `HTMLCanvasElement` and exporting it as a **downloadable WebM video** using the **`MediaRecorder` API** — **no external libraries or resources needed**.

**User:** Is .webm the only animated output format supported by MediaRecorder?

**Assistant:** Great question.

### ✅ In practice, **MediaRecorder** supports **only a limited set of formats**, and what you can use depends on:

- The **browser** and version
- The **available codecs** on the system
- The **`mimeType`** passed to `MediaRecorder`

So yes — **WebM is effectively the only format reliably supported for animated recording using `MediaRecorder`** in client-side JavaScript.

**User:** Can webm format files be easily converted to MP4 using utilities commonly found on mac?

**Assistant:** Yes, you can **easily convert WebM to MP4 on a Mac** using tools that are either built-in or commonly available. Here are your best options:

1. **FFmpeg via Homebrew**
2. **HandBrake GUI app**
3. **QuickTime (not recommended)**
