    <h2><span class="dayh2">Day 11</span> - Digital Color Representation</h2>
    
    <p>In the previous pages, we explored the nature of light and how human vision 
        perceives color. Now we turn to the practical question: how do computers 
        represent and manipulate color for display on digital devices?</p>

    <h3>The RGB Color Model</h3>
    
    <p>Most digital color systems are based on the <strong>RGB (Red, Green, Blue) 
        color model</strong>. While other color models exist (such as CMYK for 
        printing, HSV for color selection, or YUV for video), RGB has become the 
        standard for computer graphics and display devices.</p>

    <p>Display devices—whether LCD screens, OLED panels, or LED displays—create 
        colors by emitting different mixtures of red, green, and blue light. Each 
        pixel on your screen contains three sub-pixels, one for each primary color. 
        By varying the intensity of these three colors, the display can reproduce a 
        wide range of visible colors.</p>

    <h3>Digital Color Values</h3>
    
    <p>In digital systems, each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) is represented by 
        a numerical value. The most common format uses <strong>one-byte integers</strong>, 
        giving each channel a range from 0 to 255. This provides 256 possible 
        intensity levels per channel.</p>

    <p>With three channels, each using 8 bits (one byte), we get what's called 
        "24-bit color" or "true color," offering 16,777,216 possible color 
        combinations (256³). This is often written as RGB(255, 128, 64) or #FF8040 
        in hexadecimal notation.</p>

    <p>While 8-bit per channel is standard, other bit depths are certainly possible 
        and used in specialized applications:</p>
    <ul class="narrative-list">
        <li><strong>16-bit per channel</strong> (48-bit total) - Used in high-end 
            photography and video editing</li>
        <li><strong>10-bit per channel</strong> (30-bit total) - Common in 
            professional displays and HDR content</li>
        <li><strong>12-bit per channel</strong> (36-bit total) - Used in some 
            digital cinema formats</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Beyond these standard formats, specialized fields use entirely different 
        approaches. For example, the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Scientific_Data_Format" 
           target="_blank">ASDF format</a> used in astronomy enables the recording 
        of quantities across a rich variety of wavelengths, far beyond the 
        three-color RGB model. Such formats are essential for scientific 
        applications where precise spectral data is required.</p>

    <h3>The Bounded Nature of Digital Color</h3>
    
    <p>Unlike color in the natural world, digital color representation has a 
        fundamental limitation: <strong>there is an upper bound to the values</strong>. 
        In nature, light can theoretically have any intensity, from complete 
        darkness to the brightness of the sun. But in digital systems, we must work 
        within fixed limits.</p>

    <p>This bounded nature has important implications for ray tracing:</p>
    <ul class="narrative-list">
        <li><strong>Clamping</strong> - When calculations produce values outside the 
            valid range (0-255 for 8-bit), they must be "clamped" to the nearest 
            valid value</li>
        <li><strong>Precision loss</strong> - Very bright or very dark areas may 
            lose detail due to the limited range</li>
        <li><strong>Color accuracy</strong> - The finite number of possible values 
            means some subtle color variations cannot be represented</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For example, if our ray tracing calculations produce a color value of 
        RGB(300, 150, 75), we must clamp the red channel to 255, resulting in 
        RGB(255, 150, 75). This is why proper lighting calculations and exposure 
        control are crucial in ray tracing.</p>

    <h3>Beyond RGB: A Brief Note</h3>
    
    <p>While RGB dominates digital displays, it's worth noting that printed color 
        works differently. Printers typically use the <strong>CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, 
        Yellow, Key/Black) color model</strong>, which is subtractive rather than 
        additive. Instead of emitting light, printed materials absorb certain 
        wavelengths and reflect others. This fundamental difference means that the 
        same RGB values will look different on screen versus in print, requiring 
        careful color management for cross-media applications.</p>

    <p>For our ray tracing work, we'll focus primarily on RGB, as our goal is to 
        create images for digital display. Understanding how computers represent 
        color digitally is essential for implementing realistic lighting and 
        material effects in our ray tracer.</p>

    <p>However, while the 0-255 integer range serves well for final display, it 
        becomes cumbersome for the mathematical calculations involved in ray tracing. 
        Working with arbitrary integer values like 255 as a cap makes lighting 
        calculations, color mixing, and material interactions unnecessarily complex. 
        For these purposes, we will prefer using <strong>floating-point numbers</strong> 
        for our primary values. This approach simplifies our mathematical operations 
        and provides better precision for intermediate calculations. We'll explore 
        this color model in more detail in subsequent pages when we discuss a 
        representation that better suits our ray tracing needs. While our final
        output (whether image on the browser or a file) will be in RGB, we will 
        use floating-point numbers for our intermediate calculations, and the 
        benefit of that approach will be apparent when we discuss the details on 
        later pages.
