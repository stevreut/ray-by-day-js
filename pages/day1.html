        <h3>Introduction: Simulating Raster Graphics with SVG</h3>
        <p>
            This series begins by simulating raster (pixel-based) images using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). 
            While we'll eventually move to more sophisticated rendering techniques, starting with SVG provides a clear foundation for understanding how 
            individual pixels can be manipulated to create images.
            <span style="display:block; margin-top:0.5em;"><em>(If you want to dive straight into ray tracing concepts and coding, you can <a href="./day12.html">jump ahead to Day 12</a>. However, I think you will find it worthwhile to digest the concepts in these introductory pages first.)</em></span>
        </p>
        
        <h3>External SVG File Inclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Our first step demonstrates the simplest approach: including a pre-created SVG file as an external resource using
            the HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.
            This approach treats the SVG file like any other image file (PNG, JPG, etc.), but with the advantage that the SVG
            content can be examined
            and understood as structured markup rather than binary data.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The image below shows a 20×20 pixel grid where each "pixel" is actually a small SVG rectangle. This creates the
            illusion of a raster image
            while maintaining the benefits of vector graphics: scalability, inspectability, and programmatic manipulation
            potential.
        </p>
        <p>Be careful of the word "vector" in this site. On this page it refers to a category of graphics file types rather than
            the mathematical
            sense of the word "vector". In later pages we will be making frequent use of that mathematical
            understanding of the word "vector" but not on this page.
            Check out <a href="https://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=282942&p=1885352">this page</a>
            from the University of Michigan Library for a good explanation of the difference between raster and vector graphics.

        <h3>HTML referencing file day1-static.svg</h3>
        <p>
            The HTML code below shows how we reference the external SVG file using a standard <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. This is the simplest way to include 
            an SVG file in a web page, treating it just like any other image file. The browser loads the SVG file and renders it as part of the page content.

        <h3>Excerpt of contents of file day1-static.svg</h3>
        <p>
            Here we can see the actual SVG markup that creates our simulated raster image. Each <code>&lt;rect&gt;</code> element represents a single virtual "pixel" in our 
            20×20 grid. The SVG uses a coordinate system where each rectangle is positioned using x and y attributes, with colors specified by the fill attribute. 
            This structured approach makes it easy to understand how the image is constructed.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is ironic that we are using SVG, a vector graphics format, to simulate a raster image.  But it is a good way to start 
        </p>
        <pre id="svgcode">Code extract failed</pre>
        <h3>Code for generating SVG content as string</h3>
        <p>
            This is the JavaScript function that originally generated the static SVG file shown above. The function returns a complete SVG document as a string, 
            which can then be saved to a file or used directly. When you click the "Generate SVG File Content" button below, this same code will execute and 
            display the resulting SVG string in the textarea.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key aspects of this SVG generation approach:
        </p>
        <ul class="narrative-list">
            <li>The function creates a proper XML header to begin the SVG document</li>
            <li>The SVG namespace declaration in the opening <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag is required for proper rendering</li>
            <li>Each virtual pixel is formatted as a <code>&lt;rect&gt;</code> (rectangle) element with specific x, y, width, and height attributes</li>
            <li>The color of each pixel/rectangle is calculated from the row and column coordinates, creating an implicit function that returns a color based on position - this coordinate-to-color mapping is a fundamental concept we'll explore further in later contexts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For now, notice how the code that defines the pixel colors based on (x,y) coordinates is entangled with the code that creates 
            the SVG document syntax and the logical loops that iterates through all combinations of row and column.  It would be nice if 
            we could isolate the code that defines the pixel colors from the code that creates the SVG document syntax and the logical loops that 
            iterate through all combinations of row and column.  Isolating these two distinct kinds of code would allow us to 
            adjust the dimensions and resolution of the image without fussing with the code that defines the image and vice versa.  We will do exactly that
            in one of the future pages.
