    <p><i>
        Note that these pages are still being built and, as of this time (October 2025),
        will continue to change in the upcoming months.  Despite that, since I think there is 
        enough useful material in the pages to justify it, I have chosen to make the site 
        publicly accessible even as it while it is incomplete, and perhaps it will never
        quite be complete.
    </i></p>
    <p><i>
        Originally this site was developed, among other reasons, to serve as the core working
        demonstration to support a talk give for the
        <a href="https://phillyjs.com">Philadelphia JavaScript Club</a> in July of 2025.  At the
        time of that demonstration, this site was not yet completed and the explanatory content
        lagged significantly behind the working JavaScript code in the site - and that is 
        still the case.
    </i></p>
    <p>This site attempts to explain the <a href="#cgidef">CGI</a> technique called 
        "ray tracing", a computer programming technique used to 
        create realistic images of virtual three-dimensional environments by simulating 
        the passage of rays of light through a virtual environment, use the tracking ("tracing")
        of these rays to
        calculate the view/image that would be seen from a specified vantage point 
        (an "observer" or "camera") in that environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to being about ray tracing, this site is also specifically for 
        software developers and, even more specifically, those using the JavaScript 
        language. All the examples shown on this site are in JavaScript accompanied by 
        minimal HTML and CSS. In most cases the source code examples shown will be the very same 
        bits of JavaScript code used to dynamically generate the images shown on the 
        pages of this site. <i>(There is also some Node.js code in the repository as well,
        but that code is not an active part of the web site.  Most of that Node.js code 
        was used to generate static diagrams used in the site or elsewhere.)
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>Still, the real topic of this site is ray tracing, and the use of JavaScript is 
        just a means to an end. I hope that developers familiar with other programming 
        languages might still find this site useful and interesting regardless of what 
        programming language they use.
    </p>
    <p>The site is organized in an incremental day-by-day format. Each "day" in the 
        material presents one or more new ideas or concepts related to CGI and ray tracing. For 
        each day, coding examples in JavaScript are also provided. In addition to 
        observing how that code is implemented, those with an interest in doing so might 
        choose to develop their own JavaScript modules based on the ideas in these pages, 
        or use the code in these pages as a starting point for their own 
        projects using other languages.
    </p>
    <p>I make no claim that any of the techniques I've used in these pages are the best 
        or most efficient, nor do I even claim that my approach resembles any known standards for 
        how to implement ray tracing. Most of the code on these pages is the result of my own 
        trial-and-error efforts. Those more interested in the end results than the 
        process would probably be well advised to find some appropriate pre-existing CGI 
        tools rather than make use of the code in these pages. If you do make use of this 
        JavaScript code, please take a look at the terms of the associated 
        <a href="https://github.com/stevreut/ray-by-day-js/blob/main/LICENSE">licensing</a> 
        which essentially grants free use of the code with the understanding that it is 
        at your own risk. (Though attribution is not required, it would certainly be appreciated.)
