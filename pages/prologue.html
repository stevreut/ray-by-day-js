    <p>[Page under construction]</p>
    <p><i>
        Note that these pages are still being built and, as of this time (May/June 2025),
        will continue to change in the upcoming weeks.  Despite that, since I think there is 
        enough useful material in the pages to justify it, I have chosen to make the site 
        publicly accessible as of now even though the site is incomplete.
    </i></p>
    <p>This site attempts to explain the <a href="#cgidef">CGI</a> technique called "ray tracing", which is a 
        computer programming technique that can be used to create realistic images of virtual 
        three-dimensional environments by simulating the passage of virtual rays of light
        through a virtual environment in order to calculate the view/image that would be 
        perceived from a particular vantage point (an "observer" or "camera") within that
        virtual environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to being about ray tracing, this site is also specifically for software
        developers and, specifically, for those using the JavaScript language.  All the 
        examples shown on this site are in JavaScript accompanied by HTML and CSS.  In 
        most cases the source code examples shown will be the very same bits of JavaScript 
        code used to dynamically generate the images shown on the pages of this site.
    </p>
    <p>Still, the real topic of the site is ray tracing, and the use of JavaScript is just 
        a means to an end.  It is hoped that developers familiar other programming languages
        might still find this site useful and interesting.
    </p>
    <p>The site is organized in an incremental "day-by-day" format.  Each "day" in the 
        material presents an new idea or concept related to CGI and ray tracing.  For 
        each day, coding examples in JavaScript are also provided.  In addition to observing 
        how that code is implemented, those with an interest in doing so might choose to 
        develop their own JavaScript modules based on the ideas in these pages.
    </p>
    <p>I make no claim that any of the techniques I've used in these pages are the best or 
        most efficient.  Most of code on these pages is the result of my own trial-and-error 
        efforts.  Those more interested in the end results than the process would probably
        be well advised to find some appropriate pre-existing CGI tools rather than make
        use of the code in these pages.  If you do make use of this JavaScript code, please 
        take a look at the terms of the associated <a href="https://github.com/stevreut/ray-by-day-js/blob/main/LICENSE">licensing</a> which essentially 
        grants free use of the code with the understanding that it is at your own risk.
