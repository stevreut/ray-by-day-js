    <p><i>
        Note that these pages are still in development and will continue to change in the upcoming months.
        Despite that, there is
        enough useful material in the pages to justify this site being
        publicly accessible even as it continues to evolve. If there are particular pages that
        interest you that seem incomplete, check back in a few weeks to see if things have changed.
    </i></p>
    <p><i>
        One of the reasons this site was originally developed was to serve as the a working
        demonstration to support a talk given for the
        <a href="https://phillyjs.com">Philadelphia JavaScript Club</a> in July of 2025. At the
        time of that demonstration this site was not yet completed and the explanatory content
        lagged significantly behind the working JavaScript code in the site - and that is
        still the case. This is why, for now, you will find that many of the later pages of site
        are functional but do not yet have any explanatory content - a flaw which I am working to
        change little by little.
    </i></p>
    <p>This site attempts to explain the <a href="#cgidef">CGI</a> technique called
        "ray tracing", a computer programming technique used to
        create realistic images of virtual three-dimensional environments by simulating
        the passage of rays of light through a virtual environment, use the tracking ("tracing")
        of these rays to
        calculate the view/image that would be seen from a specified vantage point
        (an "observer" or "camera") in that environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to being about ray tracing, this site is also specifically for
        software developers and particularly those using the JavaScript
        language. All the examples shown on this site are in JavaScript accompanied by
        minimal HTML and CSS. In most cases the code examples shown will be the very same
        JavaScript code components used to dynamically generate the images shown on the
        pages of this site. <i>(There is also some Node.js code in the repository as well,
        but that code is not an active part of the web site. Most of that Node.js code
        was used to generate static diagrams used in the site or elsewhere.)
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Still, the real topic of this site is ray tracing, and the use of JavaScript is
        just incidental. I hope that developers familiar with other programming
        languages might still find this site useful and interesting regardless of what
        programming languages they are using.
    </p>
    <p>
        The site is organized in an incremental day-by-day format. Each "day" in the
        material presents one or more new ideas or concepts related to CGI and ray tracing. For
        each day, coding examples in JavaScript are also provided. In addition to
        observing how that code is implemented, those with an interest in doing so might
        choose to develop their own JavaScript modules based on the ideas in these pages,
        or use the code in these pages as a starting point for their own
        projects using other languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        I make no claim that any of the techniques I have used in these pages are the best
        or most efficient, nor do I even claim that my approach resembles any known standard for
        how to implement ray tracing. Most of the code on these pages is the result of my own
        trial-and-error efforts. Those more interested in the end results than the
        process would probably be well advised to find some appropriate pre-existing CGI
        tools rather than make use of the code in these pages. If you do make use of this
        JavaScript code, please take a look at the terms of the associated
        <a href="https://github.com/stevreut/ray-by-day-js/blob/main/LICENSE">licensing agreement</a>
        which grants free use of the code with the understanding that it is
        at your own risk. (Though attribution is not required, it would certainly be appreciated.)
