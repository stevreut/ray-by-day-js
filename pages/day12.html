    <h2><span class="dayh2">Day 12</span> - Object Model for Ray Tracing</h2>
    
    <p>Having explored the fundamental concepts of light, color perception, and digital 
        color representation, we now turn to the practical question of how to structure 
        a ray tracing program. The object-oriented approach provides a natural way to 
        model the components of a ray tracing system.</p>

    <h3>The Core Classes</h3>
    
    <p>At the heart of any ray tracing system are several fundamental classes that 
        represent the basic building blocks:</p>
    
    <ul class="narrative-list">
        <li><strong>Vector3D</strong> - Represents points and directions in 3D space. 
            This class handles all the mathematical operations we need for positions, 
            directions, and geometric calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>Ray</strong> - Represents a virtual ray of light with an origin 
            point (Vector3D), a direction vector (Vector3D), and a color (Color).</li>
        <li><strong>Color</strong> - Represents color values in our digital system. 
            This class manages RGB values and provides methods for color operations 
            like mixing and scaling.</li>
    </ul>

        <p><em>Class relationship diagram showing the structure of our core classes. 
            The Ray class contains two Vector3D instances (origin and direction) and 
            one Color instance, while Vector3D and Color each encapsulate three 
            numerical values.</em></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Vector Mathematics as Foundation</h3>
    
    <p>Before we can implement these classes, we need a solid foundation in vector 
        mathematics. Vectors are essential for representing:</p>
    
    <ul class="narrative-list">
        <li><strong>Positions</strong> - Points in 3D space where objects are located</li>
        <li><strong>Directions</strong> - The orientation of rays and other vectors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our vector operations will include addition, subtraction, dot products, cross 
        products, and normalization. These mathematical operations form the backbone 
        of all ray-object intersection calculations and lighting computations. More 
        on vectors in the next page.</p>

    <h3>The Ray Model</h3>
    
    <p>A Ray consists of an origin point (Vector3D), a direction vector (Vector3D), 
        and a color (Color). These three components together represent a virtual ray 
        of light in 3D space.</p>

    <h3>The Color Model</h3>
    
    <p>Our Color class uses floating-point values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 for each 
        RGB component, rather than the traditional 0-255 integer range. This approach 
        provides several advantages for ray tracing calculations.</p>

    <p>In this model, a color value of (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) represents full white, 
        equivalent to #ffffff in traditional HTML color notation. However, unlike 
        traditional color systems, our Color model can and will represent values 
        greater than 1.0 in many cases. These "super-bright" colors are essential 
        for realistic lighting calculations, where light sources and reflections 
        can produce intensities that exceed the standard display range.</p>

    <p>For example, a color value of (2.5, 1.8, 1.2) might represent a bright 
        light source or a highly reflective surface that appears much brighter 
        than pure white. These values will be clamped to the displayable range 
        when converting to final output, but maintaining the full range during 
        calculations preserves the accuracy of our lighting model.</p>

    <h3>Building from Simple Foundations</h3>
    
    <p>By starting with these three fundamental classes, we can build a ray tracing 
        system step by step. The Vector3D class provides the mathematical foundation, 
        the Ray class represents the light paths we'll trace, and the Color class 
        manages the visual output.</p>

    <p>This modular approach means we can test and refine each component independently 
        before combining them into more complex systems. We can also extend and modify 
        these classes as our understanding and requirements evolve.</p>

    <p>In the following pages, we'll implement these concepts step by step, starting 
        with the fundamental Vector3D class that will support all our geometric 
        calculations.</p>
