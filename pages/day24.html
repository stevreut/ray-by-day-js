                calculations; it does not display the resulting frames as animation content.

            causes the animation to restart from the beginning.

            this button is pressed or the page is reloaded, even though changes to the 
            settings can impact the dimensions and precision of the generated frames.

        <h3>How to use this page to create animations - step-by-step</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Adjust the various settings to reflect desired animation characteristics, 
                or leave the settings unchanged and proceed with the default values.  (Starting 
                with the defaults is a good place to start the first time.)
            </li>
            <li>Press "Generate Animation" to generate the frame data for an animation.
                This step can be time-consuming and the time required will vary based 
                on the various settings.  As the animation creation proceeds, its progress 
                can be monitored by observing the "Animation status".  Do <em>not</em> 
                press "Cancel Animation Generation" unless you explicitly want to cancel 
                all of the animation generation calculation and start over.
            </li>
            <li>Press "Start Animation" to actually display the calculated animation.  This 
                animation will loop indefinitely once started unless you intervene.
            </li>
            <li>While the animation is playing, you may choose to Pause or Stop its playback.  
                If you do so, the calculated animation frames will not be lost and the animation 
                can be easily and quickly restarted via the "Restart" or "Start Animation" 
                buttons.
            </li>
            <li>If a different random arrangement of objects in the virtual environment is desired 
                then you can press the "Randomize Environment" button, then (optionally) change 
                one or more settings, and then press "Generate Animation" to recalculate the animation.
                (Remember 
                that you will still have to press "Start Animation" after the animation has been calculated.)
            </li>
            <li>Before generating a high-resolution animation (i.e. large dimensions, small pixels, many frames, etc.), 
                you may find it useful to repeatedly (if necessary) generate animations at lower
                resolution before then changing the settings for higher resolution <em>without</em>
                pressing the "Randomize Environment" button again.  Then, once an low-resolution animation has 
                the desired composition, change settings again to re-generate using higher resolution.
            </li>
